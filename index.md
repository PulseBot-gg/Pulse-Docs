## What is Pulse?

Pulse is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) Music Bot, used to play music in the Voice Channels of a server. Pulse can also be used as a general media search engine, lyrics search engine, or media discovery platform.

## Our Goal.

Pulse was created with 3 main intentions; a free music bot, an easy way to listen with friends, and a bot with all the latest features. Today, the project has become that, and much more. Using the most popular media sources, Pulse is setting a new standard for music bots.

## Why Pulse?

 - User friendly
 - Mind-blowingly fast! <b>(No Lag)</b>
 - Full access <b>completely</b> free.
 - Highest possible audio quality.
 - Extensive integration support.
 
The goal of this project isnâ€™t to take away from your experience. If another bot has more to offer, by all means, use it instead, or you can make a suggestion by using the [Contact](https://pulseproject.io/contact) page. We are always open to new ideas and features!
