## What is Pulse?

Pulse is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) Music Bot, used to play music in the Voice Channels of a server. Pulse can also be used as a general media search engine, lyrics search engine, or media discovery platform.

## Our Goal.

Pulse was created with 3 main intentions; a free music bot, an easy way to listen with friends, and a bot with all the latest features. Today, the project has become that, and much more. Using the most popular media sources, Pulse is setting a new standard for music bots.

## Why Pulse?

 - User friendly
 - Mind-blowingly fast! <b>(No Lag)</b>
 - <b>Completely</b> free full bot access.
 - Highest possible audio quality.
 - Extensive integration support.
 
The goal of this project isnâ€™t to take away from your experience. If another bot has more to offer, by all means, use it instead, or you can make a suggestion by using the [Contact](https://pulseproject.io/contact) page. We are always open to new ideas and features!

## Adding Pulse

Adding Pulse is completely hassle and invasive free! You can get an invite link by vising the [invite](https://pulseproject.io/invite) page, and clicking the button for the bot you want! If you are having problems getting Pulse to work properly, or if you just want to be safe, use the Administrator invite!

## Setup

If you are visiting this page because you had problems installing or using Pulse, simply kick the bot from the server and follow the instructions below.

Unfortunately, this is the hardest and most crucial part, but don't stress because its not hard!
 - **Get the help command for the bot.** <br>You can find the prefix for the bot you want to use by checking the [invite](https://pulseproject.io/invite) page, or by looking at the bot's status.
 - **Run the help command, and read everything!** <br>Pay special attention to the links, configuration command, and server command prefix.
 - **Run the config command, and configure.** <br>Here is where you can control how Pulse interacts with the server. You can view more information on each configuration value by running the command for that value. You can set the bot's prefix, text-channel, DJ-Role restrictions, and more!
 - **Enjoy!** <br>The bot is really straight-forward! Pulse has a really nice [commands](https://docs.pulseproject.io/docs/commands.html) UI for finding what you need fast, and if you want to know more about Pulse's integrations, check out the [integrations](https://docs.pulseproject.io/Integrations) documentation.
