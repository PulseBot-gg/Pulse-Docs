## Why should I donate, and how?

 - Since Pulse is a free-to-use bot, donations are not required. That does not mean that the bot is free to host for the creator of the project. Your donation will help keep Pulse alive. If you would like to contribute, you can donate [here](https://pulseproject.io/donate).

<br>

## What do I get for donating?

 - At the moment, you get no additional features or perks for donating to the Pulse Project, as the project itself was founded on the basis that a free, feature-packed bot should be available to everyone. We suggest you purchase a premium membership instead.

<br>

## How do I change the channel Pulse messages in?

 - Pulse uses a unique channel tracking system. When you issue a command to pulse, it outputs it’s response to that channel. If the command is successful, it’s output channel will be set to the current channel. If the command fails, it will continue outputting to the previous channel if it exists. If no previous channel exists anymore, it will output to the new channel.
<br>
<br>
If you wish to restrict Pulse to one channel only, you can set the channel using the configuration command. If the configured output channel gets deletes, that configuration value will be reset.

<br>

## How are permissions determined?

 - Pulse has a few basic commands that all users have access to like play, queue, and lyrics. Commands that modify the playing track or queue can be restricted by enabling the usage of the DJ role. If you wish to allow others to modify the bot’s configuration, they must have the MANAGE_SERVER permission.

<br>

## How many votes are needed in order to skip a track?

Currently, the bot requires the majority 2/3 of the members in the channel besides any bots, to pass a skip.
<br.
<br>
If someone leaves the channel, their vote gets removed from the active vote to skip. Additionally, when someone leaves the current channel, the votes to skip gets re-evaluated, and skips to the next track automatically if there are enough votes.

<br>

## What types of limits does the bot have?

 - None at the moment, but in the future, any limitations put in place are there to provide the best experience for other servers. Other than that, if the bot can do it reasonably, it will.
<br>
<br>
 If you believe any of the limitations are too strict or that there is a missing limitation impairing your experience because of others, feel free to Contact us.

<br>

## Can Pulse play 24/7?

 - Short answer; kind of.
<br>
<br>
Theoretically you could, yes. Realistically however, updates, bugs, data-center shutdowns, server hosting changes, API changes, and similar reasons can all cause an interruption in your listening experience. We will always try to keep the bot running, but realistically it’s impossible.
